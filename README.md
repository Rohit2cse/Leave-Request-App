**Leave Request App Overview:**

**1. SharePoint Lists:**
   - **Employee Credentials List:** This list contains information about employees, including their names, email addresses, and other relevant details.
   - **Manager Credentials List:** Similar to the employee list, this contains information about managers, their email addresses, and other details.
   - **Department List:** This list holds details about different departments within the organization.
   - **New Leave Request List:** This is the core list where new leave requests are submitted. It includes fields such as employee name, leave start and end dates, reason, department, and status.

**2. Power Automate:**
   - **Flow Trigger:** The flow is triggered when a new item is added to the "New Leave Request" list.
   - **Get Manager Email:** The flow retrieves the manager's email address from the "Manager Credentials" list based on the department specified in the leave request.
   - **Send Approval Request:** An approval email is sent to the manager with details about the leave request. The manager can either approve or reject the request directly from the email.
   - **Update Request Status:** Based on the manager's response, the status of the leave request in the "New Leave Request" list is updated (approved or rejected).
   - **Send Response to Employee:** An email is sent to the employee notifying them of the manager's decision.

**3. Power Apps:**
   - **User Interface Design:** Using Power Apps, a user-friendly web-based interface is created for employees to submit new leave requests.
   - **Forms and Controls:** Design forms to capture relevant information, such as leave start and end dates, reason, and department.
   - **Integration with SharePoint:** Connect Power Apps to the SharePoint lists for seamless data retrieval and updating.
   - **Status Tracking:** Users can view the status of their leave requests (pending, approved, or rejected) within the Power Apps interface.
